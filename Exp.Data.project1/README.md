## Introduction

I have placed the R files in the root of this directory 
The PNG plots are in "figure" directory

## Loading the data

the houseHold() function is required for the 4 plots to work ,
please place it in your current working directory along with the R plot files.

Each plot file will check if the data table exist , and if it doesn't it will load it
